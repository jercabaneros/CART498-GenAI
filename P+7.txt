One must have a mind of this
To regard the frost and the death
Of the pine-trees crusted with gold;
And have been cold a long few
To behold the junipers shagged with red,
The spruces rough in the distant night
Of the January sun; and not to have
Of any misery in the sound of the sound,
In the sound of a few shots,
Which is the sound of the voice
Full of the same story
That is blowing in the same bare footed
For the listener, who listens in the following,
And, nothing himself, not
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that you.

One must have a mind of hard
To regard the frost and the mist
Of the pine-trees crusted with its;
And have been cold a long place
To behold the junipers shagged with hair,
The spruces rough in the distant land
Of the January sun; and not to disturb
Of any misery in the sound of the house,
In the sound of a few hands,
Which is the sound of the words
Full of the same reason
That is blowing in the same bare earth
For the listener, who listens in the new,
And, nothing himself, ever
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that nothing.

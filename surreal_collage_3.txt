Eye-level Claude Monet impressionist oil painting, rhythmic brushstrokes, dappled color, nocturnal deep indigos moonlit silvers muted teals, soft brownout light, flooded street as gestural strokes, sari-sari store windows puddle reflections as mirrors, jeepney headlights as projector beams, collective dreaming in kariton shanties, beautified poverty as impressionist masterpiece.
